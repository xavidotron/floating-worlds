  <blockquote>"In all fiction when a man is faced with alternatives he
  chooses one at the expense of the others. In the almost unfathomable
  Ts'ui Pen, he chooses--simultaneously--all of them. He thus creates
  various futures, various times which start others that will in their
  turn branch out and bifurcate in other times."

  - Jorge Luis Borges, The Garden of Forking Paths</blockquote>

  A Garden of Forking Paths is a LARP told in scenes. This is a game
  heavily inspired by Jeep format, not a traditional LARP. In each
  scene, four characters will face certain dilemmas, and make
  decisions that will affect the course of their lives. At the same
  time, two other groups of players will be playing the same
  characters and, possibly, making different decisions. Between
  scenes, players will be shuffled into different groups. They will
  generally play the same characters, but those characters may have
  made different decisions in the prior scene, causing them to start
  the next scene in a different situation.
