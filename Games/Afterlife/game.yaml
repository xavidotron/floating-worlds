blurb: |
  There was a deep darkness. Then a burning light. And now you're here.

  Whatever you thought the afterlife would be, this isn't what you
  expected. Your soul feels restless, fraying. Unless you manage to
  connect it to a proper afterlife soon, you'll be stuck like this
  forever.

  This is a mildly serious, vaguely philosophical game about exploring
  the afterlife, figuring out why you died, and deciding where to go
  from here.

  Afterlife is a lightweight 2-hour secrets-and-rituals game for 11-17
  players originally written for X Camp 2014 by Xavid, Jayson Lynch,
  Katie Sedlar, and Faye Dukhovni.

  Content Warning: All characters have died just before game start,
  mostly in unpleasant ways. Game includes suicide and suicidal and
  psychopathic characters. Game includes many casual references to
  Christianity, Satanism, Buddhism, and Egyptian and Norse mythology;
  players with strong religious beliefs may be offended. Recommended
  for ages 13+.
