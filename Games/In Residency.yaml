  <em>In Residency</em> is about the relationship between trauma and art, and
  about the weird atmosphere of artists’ colonies, where intensely
  personal daily work rubs up against a claustrophobic cocktail-party
  environment at night. Brython: it’s where we’re all alone together.

  <em>In Residency</em> is a short, live action <a href="http://leavingmundania.com/2013/11/18/introducing-american-freeform/">American Freeform</a> game for
  10-16 players about the relationship between trauma and art, and
  about the weird atmosphere of artists’ colonies, where intensely
  personal daily work rubs up against a claustrophobic cocktail-party
  environment at night. Brython: it’s where we’re all alone together.

  For residents at this elite artists’ colony, Brython represents the
  chance to live full time as their most secret selves, ignoring
  everything but their sacred drive to elevate the soul through
  art. By day, they make art in the beautiful surroundings of a fully
  staffed mansion, transforming their dark pasts into beauty. By
  night, they live in a fishbowl of observation and unresolved sexual
  tension. Will they overcome impostor syndrome to work on the
  projects they said they would? Will their off-colony relationships
  survive? Or will it all degenerate into Bacchanalia?
