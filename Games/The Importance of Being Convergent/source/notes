Magna Carta system that you can only amend at the Festival of 
Metamorphosis/the Butterfly.  Threeish political Tradition vs Change:
Most people don't feel strongly, try to convince people to vote your way.
A: abandon traditional prohibition on strong alliances to make this mutual
   defense treaty with a neigboring country (not the one foreign spy is from)
   (make us stronger vs they could draw us into wars)
F: end prohibition against using fire magic in battle
   (could escalate conflicts/lead to retaliation, could give us advantage)
W: allow export of elemental gems that's traditionally been forbidden
   (could make us richer, could weaken our magic)

Tie breaker is leader of relevant guild.
Tie breaker for caste vote is the earth leader, because this game makes all
the sense.

Classes normally much more divided, only formalized interactions, this
is an unusual gathering.

Schedule:
T+45: vote on questions
T+60: realign the heavens
after that: weddings and dramatic revealations!

Start with 5 gems of your apparent class, need 2 of your actual class and one
of each other to make a butterfly?

When trading gems, remember to chat and interact according to your relative
stations.

To make a butterfly, tell someone a secret about you they don't already know.

Butterfly is of your actual color, but you can try to hide it from people.
