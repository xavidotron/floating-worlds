%% This is intended as a nearly complete rules and scenario document

%% include living spaces.  Some possibly useful sentences/paragraphs
%% are simply commented out.

%% Feel free to ignore these comments and just write what you want.

%% These rules are merely an example ruleset.  Nothing in them is

%%
%% However, much of the material presented here, especially in the
%% Getting Started and Items Etc. sections, may be taken for granted
%% by many players.  This has two major implications:
%%
%% 1) Because of gradual shifts, longstanding biases, and first
%% impressions, different players (and GMs!) may have very different
%% assumptions about some details.  Do not brush off the sections that
%% "everyone knows."  Make sure everyone pays attention to the rules
%% as a whole.
%%
%% 2) If you have a clever idea to change some detail in the
%% fundamental parts of the rules, make sure to draw attention to it.
%% For example, if you modify the item bulkiness rules, don't just
%% gloss over your changes in the middle of a paragraph.
%%
%% You may want a section at the end as a reference to any fundamental
%% changes.  See "New Rule Summary" at the end.

%%
%%
%%
%% Basic guidelines for rules-writing:
%%
%% Use simple, concise, and precise language.  Avoid colloquialisms
%% and speech mannerisms.  Write in the second person.  Use the
%% imperative voice when possible.  Write like you are writing
%% directions.
%%
%% When you change contexts, like going from writing to the attacker
%% to writing to the defender, at least change paragraphs.
%%
%% When first introducing a major term and/or abbreviation, use bold
%% text.  Try to define terms before you use them.  Combined with
%% section/subsection/paragraph headings, this will make the rules
%% easier to skim for reference.  First establish context, then go
%% into detail.
%%
%% Be thorough, but do not ramble.  Try to make the spirit of the
%% rules clear in addition to the letter.  If the spirit is hard to
%% relay, then the rule may be too complicated.

\name{\emph{\gamename} Scenario and Rules}

\section{Background}

\sHomeCountry{} is a small but ancient kingdom, boasting great mineral
wealth, large stretches of fertile farmland, and a prosperous port on
the Inland Sea.  It is generally considered a monarchy, but its customs
differ from those of the neighboring kingdoms: \sTreatyCountry{},
strong in trade and metalwork;
\sMulanCountry{}, aggressive and independent; and \sSpyCountry{},
known for strong guilds and universities.

\sHomeCountry{}'s most distinctive feature is its strong caste system.
Every individual is born into one of the four castes, each based around
one of the elements: Air, Fire, Water, or Earth.  Each caste has rigidly
defined roles in society and a rigidly defined place in the social hierarchy:

\begin{itemz}
\item \textbf{Air}: aristocrats and artists, tasked with governance over the
  land and owed fealty by the other three castes.
\item \textbf{Fire}: soldiers and commanders, charged with national defense
  and military operations under Air government oversight.
\item \textbf{Water}: merchants, traders, shopkeepers, and clerics.  The Water
  caste is responsible for both domestic and international commerce and much
  of the operations of urban life, and pays taxes that support the upper two
  castes.
\item \textbf{Earth}: peasants, farmers, woodcutters, and miners.  The
  Earth caste works hard to provide the raw materials of the nation,
  and make payments in kind to the other castes in exchange for
  the land they work, protection, and opportunities
  to trade.
\end{itemz}

\sHomeCountry{} has long maintained a policy of isolationism, avoiding
entanglement in international affairs.  Some believe that
\sHomeCountry{}'s continued independence and prosperity despite being
a small country without strong allies is due to its strong magic, tied
to the elemental gems that are found only in \sHomeCountry{} and said
to be preserved by maintaining the restrictions of the caste system.
Many of \sHomeCountry{}'s traditions are based around the ideas of
keeping the elements pure and strong: for example, it is forbidden to
transport any elemental gems outside \sHomeCountry{}'s borders, to
marry further than one caste above or below your
own,\footnote{Marrying outside your caste at all is frowned upon, but
  it does happen once in a great while.} or to use magic in violence.
Elemental magic is used widely in daily life in \sHomeCountry{} for
everything from practical purposes like growing crops and fast
transportation to such things as delicate moving sculptures and
cakes that defy gravity.  However, magic takes much preparation,
and any supernatural activities other than those involved
in the Convergence itself would be highly improper.

\section{The Convergence}

\begin{itemz}[Game Schedule]
\item \textbf{45 minutes in}: voting on the Questions of Tradition
\item \textbf{1 hour in}: the Realignment takes place
\item \textbf{1:30 in}: end of the period for auspicious weddings
\end{itemz}

\vskip.5\baselineskip

The most unusual feature of \sHomeCountry{}'s caste system is that it
is not the immutable structure one might expect.  Every 100 years, a
mystical Convergence of the four elements occurs, and it is
possible to reshape the structure of society.  Today, you are
privileged to be part of one of the four castes' delegations to the
Convergence.  With the proper application of magic and spiritual energy,
you could create a Realignment and change
the ordering of the castes for the next 100 years.

Of course, a complete rearrangement of society would be chaos.  The
possibilities before you, while significant, are restricted.  The
Realignment could at most exchange the position of any two adjacent
castes.  Thus, you could swap Air and Fire, Fire and Water, or Water
and Earth.  Alternately, you could decide against a Realignment
and maintain the status quo.

A newly raised caste would attain additional prestige and privilege, and
now receives fealty and support from a caste that used to be above
them.  In addition, a Realignment changes which individuals outside
your caste you would be eligible to marry.

With the new possibilities for marriage after a Realignment and the general
holiness of the Convergence, weddings are frequently carried out immediately
after a Realignment.  The first thirty minutes after the Realignment
are thought to be particularly auspicious, bringing great fortune and
happiness to the new couple.

\subsection{Questions of Tradition}

Beyond the possibility of a Realignment, the Convergence is also the
traditional time to revisit key principles of law and custom in \sHomeCountry{},
traditions that have been enshrined with great force.  Castes can propose
alterations to the traditions of \sHomeCountry{}, and the delegates vote
to decide these Questions.

This Convergence, three Questions have been brought before the delegates:

\begin{itemz}
\item \textbf{Air}:
  Should \sHomeCountry{} abandon its policy of isolationism and pursue
  an alliance and mutual defense agreement with \sTreatyCountry{}?
\item \textbf{Fire}: Should the prohibition of
  magic in battle be removed, and research into the use
  of Fire magic in combat be permitted?
\item \textbf{Water}: Should the ban on exporting elemental gems be
  lifted, allowing trade of these goods with foreign markets?
\end{itemz}

No further questions may be proposed; the time for doing so,
as magically codified in the
laws of \sHomeCountry{}, is long past.

\section{Rules}

This is a game.  Have fun.  Don't take it too seriously.

There is no combat system.  Feel free to roleplay duels or other sorts
of contests, however.

All characters were written as gender-neutral; feel free to decide
what gender you are.  There are no customs or traditions against
same-sex relationships or marriages in \sHomeCountry{}, nor are
there other gender-based restrictions or customs.

Many of you have secrets (gasp!).  This isn't some cut-throat
competition.  We find you get better stories if secrets get out during
game, so we encourage players to set up dramatic revelations, even if
the characters would be trying to keep things hidden.

Some people may be in disguise (gasp!).  You start off with the name
badge matching the name on your character sheet.  If you have another
name badge in your packet, and you reveal your true identity publicly, you may
wear your alternate badge.

\subsection{Gems and Butterflies}

Elemental gems are represented by glass beads.  They come in
four colors: pink for air, orange for fire, blue for water, and green
for earth.  To summon your spirit butterfly, you need
elemental gems in some particular combination: two of
your elemental affinity and one of each other element.
Each character has an envelope that specifies the exact set of
five gems they need.

Once you have the proper gems, you must activate them by
a sharing of trust.  This requires you to tell someone a secret about
you they don't already know.  (Use a secret from your character
sheet, unless somehow everyone in game already knows all your secrets.)

After you've activated your gems, you can summon your spirit
butterfly.  This consumes your gems, and they can no longer be traded.
Open your envelope and take the butterfly out.  Each butterfly is
colored based on the summoner's elemental affinity.  Butterflies are
quite compliant once summoned, and can be treated and concealed like
ordinary physical objects.

Once you have a butterfly, you can use it to steer the Realignment.
There will be marked areas to place butterflies for different possible
Realignments.  You may place a butterfly you have there at any time.
Placed butterflies cannot be removed.  The option
with the most butterflies at the time of Realignment will take effect.
Ties will be broken by the leader of the Earth delegation.

If Air is displaced, the new monarch of all \sHomeCountry{} will be
chosen by the departing ruler, \cRoyalty{}.

\subsection{Questions of Tradition}

Determining whether to change enshrined traditions will be decided by
a show of hands among delegates.  In the case of a tie, the leader
of the delegation from the caste that proposed the question will
decide.
