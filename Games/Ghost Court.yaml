desc: A ridiculous party game about ghosts and the people who sue them.
blurb: |
  What you are about to witness is real. The participants are not
  actors. They are the living people and ghosts who have already
  either filed suit or been served a summons to appear in municipal
  court. Both parties in the suit have agreed to dismiss their court
  cases and have their disputes settled here, in our forum: Ghost
  Court.

  Ghost Court is a ridiculous party game about ghosts and the people
  who sue them.
