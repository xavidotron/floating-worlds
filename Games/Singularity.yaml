desc: A Transhuman Dating Show LARP
blurb: |
  Singularity! Humanityâ€™s most popular dating show, where all our
  guests find that special someone (or something!) [Applause.] Broadcast
  to over ten planets across four realities, Singularity matches each
  lucky guest Star with three suitors and allows them to choose the
  one they feel will take them to the top of the world... and beyond.

  Humankind has discovered the technology to surpass our previous
  form. No longer bound by the rules of humanity, we are able to craft
  ourselves anew. With our bodies expanded and identities altered, our
  sense of self can now linger in the space between abstraction and
  self-actualization. Humanity has become something else, something
  other.

  No longer the narrow flock of eshy humanoid we once were, you will
  instead find androids, human-esque constructs, abstract qualities such
  as Joy and Happiness made sentient, living next door to an ageless
  being with no face. Massive, living computer banks work side-by-side
  with quantum ghosts and electric skeletons. People change who and
  what they are according to in nite possibility.

  With all our fantastic, impossible advancements, one fundamental
  aspect of humanity still eludes us.
