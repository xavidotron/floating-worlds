  In a future where Earth has been forgotten, a small crew of pirates
  struggles to keep flying on the edge of known space. They are a
  cutthroat band of vultures and opportunists. Some want a promotion
  by any means necessary. Others want to get rich and get out. The
  captain just wants to keep them all in line. And half the galaxy
  wants the whole lot dead. An interstellar war is about to launch
  between a fading empire and one upstart planet. Captain Huckabee
  Capone and the crew of the Tender Loving Care race to take a stand
  with the rebels. These pirates will have to sort out their
  differences or be torn apart in the crossfire.
