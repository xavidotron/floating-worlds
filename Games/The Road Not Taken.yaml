  When you are lost in the yellow woods of your life, which road will you
  travel?
blurb: |
  The Road Not Taken merges the format of Alleged Entertainment's 10
  Bad LARPs with the serious concept of psychodrama. You are presented
  with a dilemma and all you can hear are the voices in your
  head. When you are lost in the yellow woods of your life, which road
  will you travel? <i>This game deals with adult decisions and situations
  and is not recommended for minors.</i>

  In The Road Not Taken, players take turns facing a difficult
  decision with the rest of the players portraying the voices in their
  head who want to gide them in different directions. It can get a
  little intense.
