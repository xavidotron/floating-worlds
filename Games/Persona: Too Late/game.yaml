  You f*cked it all up. You could've saved the world, but you fell
  into distrust and jealousy, and Death found you easy pickings. But
  now you have a chance to turn back the clock and fix your
  mistakes. Can you learn to work together, or is it really too late?
blurb: |
  You f*cked it all up. You had a month to work together, to build
  your connections with those who unknowingly depend on you, to build
  your power and wrest the world back from the Shadows. But no one
  could agree who to trust, and in-fighting and deceit made your
  well-functioning team into a bunch of pathetic losers. And now Death
  Himself stalks the skies, and your university and the entire town
  lie in ruins. It is too late to do anything to stop him. Your power
  is based on your connections to others, and those are all torn to
  shreds.

  But then a mysterious masked figure appears. She says she can give
  you a second chance, a chance to revisit your mistakes. Even in a
  world of Arcana, Shadows, and mythic powers, it seems unthinkable,
  but you grasp at any shreds of hope. But after everything that's
  happened, can you really rebuild your lost trust? And what if your
  companions have already been lost to the shadows? Regardless, you
  have to act fast, or it really will be too late.

  Persona: Too Late is loosely inspired by the video games Persona 3
  and Persona 4 (and rejected ideas from the 10-day Contact). No
  experience with the source material is expected or useful. It
  features time travel, social links, open-ended roleplaying,
  traitors, leveling up, and combat with shadows. Combat is via a
  card-based mechanic; time-travel involves either combat or short
  scenes in the past.

  Game has some dark themes, including references to student deaths,
  drugs, and suicide, and uses some swear words.
