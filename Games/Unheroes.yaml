  You were superheroes who screwed up big time, though you don’t
  remember it. No one does. Reality was altered and the history that
  you used to know no longer exists, and never did. Now it’s trying to
  reassert itself. Will you leave the world like this, or change
  things back?
blurb: |
  You’re all normal people. You’re here, in this normal place, doing
  whatever normal thing you’re doing. If you’re at a convention,
  you’re at a convention. If you’re in a bar, you’re in a
  bar. Everyone around you is getting on with their lives – they’re
  perfectly normal, just like you.  Except that you weren't normal
  before. You were superheroes, the saviours of Herotopia, though you
  don’t remember it. No one does. The whole world was changed, and the
  history that you used to know no longer exists, and never
  existed. But it’s trying to reassert itself.  What happens if it
  does? Why did everything change in the first place?  You're the only
  ones with the answers.
