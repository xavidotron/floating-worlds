  Figuring out how to live with other humans is hard- figuring out how
  to live with aliens is a whole 'nother game!

  Congratulations! Youâ€™ve been selected as part of the first
  Human/Xolarean Cultural Rooming Exchange! You will be attending a
  summit between the humans and the Xolareans. You will be responsible
  for brokering a successful roommate contract with the other
  Delegation. You have two hours to negotiate this contract, and it is
  VERY IMPORTANT that you come to some sort of terms that both parties
  can live with. Be generous and gracious- Human/Xolarean relations
  depend on you!
