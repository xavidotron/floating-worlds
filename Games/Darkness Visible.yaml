  England, 17th century. Civil war rages. Plague, fire and heresy
  ravage the land. The European Enlightenment movement beckons, fed by
  study and scholarship hailing back to the ancient Greeks preserved
  and built upon by Muslim scholars, and forever changing the course
  of knowledge and politics in the Christian west.

  In 1608, John Milton is born. Poet, theologian, political and social
  theorist and radical. From an idealist scholar to a disillusioned
  blind and ailing master poet. His works influenced centuries of
  English speaking poets and writers, undergirded the burgeoning
  French and American revolutions, and foreshadowed feminist critiques
  of society (perhaps despite himself).

  In <i>Paradise Lost</i>, Milton's great epic poem, Satan raises a host of
  heaven against God. Milton's anti-hero has perilous parallels with
  the author and his chosen partisans, who rise up against Charles the
  First and eventually take the head of the King of England.

  Explore <i>Paradise Lost</i> from the inside. And examine the many
  sides of Milton.
