<h1>In Residency</h1>

<p><em>In Residency</em> is a short, live action <a href="http://leavingmundania.com/2013/11/18/introducing-american-freeform/">American Freeform</a> game for
10-16 players about the relationship between trauma and art, and
about the weird atmosphere of artists’ colonies, where intensely
personal daily work rubs up against a claustrophobic cocktail-party
environment at night. Brython: it’s where we’re all alone together.<p>For residents at this elite artists’ colony, Brython represents the
chance to live full time as their most secret selves, ignoring
everything but their sacred drive to elevate the soul through
art. By day, they make art in the beautiful surroundings of a fully
staffed mansion, transforming their dark pasts into beauty. By
night, they live in a fishbowl of observation and unresolved sexual
tension. Will they overcome impostor syndrome to work on the
projects they said they would? Will their off-colony relationships
survive? Or will it all degenerate into Bacchanalia?
