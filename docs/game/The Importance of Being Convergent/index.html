<h1>The Importance of Being Convergent</h1>

<p>Tetrana is a small but ancient and prosperous kingdom. Its most
distinctive feature is its strong caste system, which divides every
individual into a rigid caste based on affinity to one of the four
elements: Air, Fire, Water, or Earth. Each caste has rigidly defined
roles and a strict place in the social hierarchy.<p>Most unusually, however, every 100 years a mystical Convergence of
the four elements reshapes the structure of Tetranan society,
allowing the caste hierarchy to be realigned! This is obviously a
most important event, and you are privileged to represent one of the
four castes at the Convergence, with the power to determine if a
Realignment will occur. You do this, of course, by using your
elemental gems to summon your spirit butterfly. Because everything
about Tetrana makes perfect sense.<p>Of course, it'd be highly improper for anyone to pretend to be a
member of a caste they are not, and especially so at such an
important event that will decide the future of the country for the
next century. So you have every assurance that everyone is exactly
who they appear to be.<p>"The Importance of Being Convergent" is a short game of politics,
secret identities, and romance, but primarily ridiculousness. It won
2nd place in the Iron GM contest at Intercon N. It is optimized more
for roleplaying, humor, and dramatic scenes than for cutthroat
competition, and has few mechanics.
