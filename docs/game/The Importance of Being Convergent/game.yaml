  Every 100 years a mystical Convergence of the four elements reshapes
  the structure of Tetranan society, allowing the caste hierarchy to
  be realigned! Of course, it'd be highly improper for anyone to
  pretend to be a member of a caste they are not, so you have every
  assurance that everyone is exactly who they appear to be.
blurb: |
  Tetrana is a small but ancient and prosperous kingdom. Its most
  distinctive feature is its strong caste system, which divides every
  individual into a rigid caste based on affinity to one of the four
  elements: Air, Fire, Water, or Earth. Each caste has rigidly defined
  roles and a strict place in the social hierarchy.

  Most unusually, however, every 100 years a mystical Convergence of
  the four elements reshapes the structure of Tetranan society,
  allowing the caste hierarchy to be realigned! This is obviously a
  most important event, and you are privileged to represent one of the
  four castes at the Convergence, with the power to determine if a
  Realignment will occur. You do this, of course, by using your
  elemental gems to summon your spirit butterfly. Because everything
  about Tetrana makes perfect sense.

  Of course, it'd be highly improper for anyone to pretend to be a
  member of a caste they are not, and especially so at such an
  important event that will decide the future of the country for the
  next century. So you have every assurance that everyone is exactly
  who they appear to be.

  "The Importance of Being Convergent" is a short game of politics,
  secret identities, and romance, but primarily ridiculousness. It won
  2nd place in the Iron GM contest at Intercon N. It is optimized more
  for roleplaying, humor, and dramatic scenes than for cutthroat
  competition, and has few mechanics.
