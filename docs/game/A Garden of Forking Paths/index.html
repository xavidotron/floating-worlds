<h1>A Garden of Forking Paths</h1>

<p><blockquote>"In all fiction when a man is faced with alternatives he
chooses one at the expense of the others. In the almost unfathomable
Ts'ui Pen, he chooses--simultaneously--all of them. He thus creates
various futures, various times which start others that will in their
turn branch out and bifurcate in other times."<p>- Jorge Luis Borges, The Garden of Forking Paths</blockquote><p>Each year, Barbara has a garden party for her birthday. She brings
her family to enjoy a quiet meal in her beautiful and well-tended
garden. This game charts the course of her life and the lives of
those around her through the decisions made at these parties.<p>A Garden of Forking Paths is a LARP told in scenes. This is a game
heavily inspired by Jeep format, not a traditional LARP. In each
scene, four characters will face certain dilemmas, and make
decisions that will affect the course of their lives. At the same
time, two other groups of players will be playing the same
characters and, possibly, making different decisions. Between
scenes, players will be shuffled into different groups. They will
generally play the same characters, but those characters may have
made different decisions in the prior scene, causing them to start
the next scene in a different situation.
