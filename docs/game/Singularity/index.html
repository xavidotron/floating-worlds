<h1>Singularity</h1>

<p>Singularity! Humanityâ€™s most popular dating show, where all our
guests find that special someone (or something!) [Applause.] Broadcast
to over ten planets across four realities, Singularity matches each
lucky guest Star with three suitors and allows them to choose the
one they feel will take them to the top of the world... and beyond.<p>Humankind has discovered the technology to surpass our previous
form. No longer bound by the rules of humanity, we are able to craft
ourselves anew. With our bodies expanded and identities altered, our
sense of self can now linger in the space between abstraction and
self-actualization. Humanity has become something else, something
other.<p>No longer the narrow flock of eshy humanoid we once were, you will
instead find androids, human-esque constructs, abstract qualities such
as Joy and Happiness made sentient, living next door to an ageless
being with no face. Massive, living computer banks work side-by-side
with quantum ghosts and electric skeletons. People change who and
what they are according to in nite possibility.<p>With all our fantastic, impossible advancements, one fundamental
aspect of humanity still eludes us.<p><big>Finding the <b>one.</b></big>
