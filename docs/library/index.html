<tr><td><a href="../game/Persona: Too Late/">Persona: Too Late</a></td><td>You f*cked it all up. You could've saved the world, but you fell
into distrust and jealousy, and Death found you easy pickings. But
now you have a chance to turn back the clock and fix your
mistakes. Can you learn to work together, or is it really too late?

the structure of Tetranan society, allowing the caste hierarchy to
be realigned! Of course, it'd be highly improper for anyone to
pretend to be a member of a caste they are not, so you have every
assurance that everyone is exactly who they appear to be.
